<br/>Set Java_Home and Maven_Home in environmental variables

To check if Java and maven are installed in your Machine:

```

## Creating testdata
To create API test data, use jsonTestData.json file in test/resource
<br/>"getCars": { 
  <br/>    "endpoint":"/v1/Categories/UsedCars.json",
   <br/> "method" : "get",
  <br/>      "auth" : "noAuth",

  ## Validations
  
  > All API uri response code is validated for status code 200
  
  > The response data is then asserted with the acceptance criteria 
  
  > The UI data is asserted with the business requirement, if any step fail the test scenario will fail.
  
  > One scenario will get failed as the test data does not match with the details in UI
  

## How to run the test
